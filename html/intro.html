 <h1 style="color:blue;">Sacred Heart Hostel.</h1>
 <br><br>


 The main concern of Sacred Heart Hostel is character formation coupled<br> with intellectual formation of the students.
 All the inmates are expected to co-operate<br> fully with the Director  and Assistant Directors and with one another in<br> 
 achieving these objectives. They should not engage any activity which may be<br> detrimental to realizing these two 
 objectives.<br><br>
 
 The motto of Sacred Heart Hostel is "TOWARDS LIFE ABUNDANT". <br>The Hostel has 2 Blocks with 132 rooms
 (single and multiple beds) and 2<br> big halls  accommodate a total of 518 students. The Hostel 
 provides <br>2 Messes and there are 2 Dining halls with a modern kitchen. Visitors'<br> Room, Reading cum
 Library Room, Music Room, Television Room,<br> Indoor Games Room, Prayer cum Meeting Hall and a Public
 Address <br>System are the other facilities of the hostel.<br><br></p></div>

<h2 style="color:blue;">RULES AND REGULATIONS.</h2><br>
<h3 style="color:blue;">Admission:</h3><br><br>

Students will be admitted to the Hostel only after admission to the College and a<br> personal interview with the Director.
 The parent of the candidate has to be present <br>at the interview by the Director. Application for admission in the form
 prescribed <br>should be accompanied by a certificate from the Parish Priest (for Catholics) and<br> from the authorities of the
 hostel or institution where the student previously resided.<br> Membership of the Hostel is for only one year. Senior students 
 wishing to be readmitted <br>will repeat the same procedure for readmission. Those who have not shown sufficient<br> improvement in 
 their studies and have been failing consistently in the examinations <br>may be denied renewal of membership. Dismissal or 
 suspension of a member from the<br> College will involve automatic dismissal or suspension from the Hostel also.<br><br></p></div>

<div class="c">
<p>
<h3 style="color:blue;">Mess Time:</h3><br><br>

Breakfast : 7.00 Am. To 8.00 Am.<br>
Lunch : 12.30 Pm. To 2.00 Pm.<br>
Supper : 7.00 Pm. To 8.00 Pm.<br><br><br></p></div>



<div class="d">
<p>
<h3 style="color:blue;">Study and Silence:</h3><br><br>

All are expected to be present on the reopening day of the <br>College i.e. whenever the College reopens after a break. 
All<br> should attend classes punctually and be present in their rooms <br>during study hours. The hostel should be a place
where at certain <br>hours, all the students are able to do quiet, undisturbed and serious study.<br>

Everyone should cultivate the habit of hard and consistent work.<br> Strict silence is to be observed from 8.30 pm.
to 7.30 am. on all days.<br> At the beginning of the silence time, the hostellers pray together when<br> a prayer song is 
played over the public address system. Students should <br>stand outside their rooms during this sacred time.<br>

Absence from the hostel at night without written permission from the <br>Director is a serious fault. If anyone has a 
good reason to go out after<br> 8.30 pm. or expects to return late, he should obtain a late-chit either <br>from the Director 
or the Asst. Director. Day scholars are not allowed <br>inside the hostel premises during silence hours and during class hours.<br><br></p>

<div class="e">
<p>
<h3 style="color:blue;">Discipline:</h3><br><br>

Responsibility and self-discipline are the only means to success in life and<br> these are necessary for community living.
To help the students acquire responsibility<br> and self-discipline and with a view to providing order and harmony in the
hostel <br>campus and an atmosphere for hard work and study, the following guidelines are presented.</p></div>
